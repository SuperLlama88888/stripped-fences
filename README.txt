MCBE fences are a pain.

You give it the side and top/bottom textures. Top/bottom texture is easy. But side texture is a pain.

Not only do you need to fill the entire texture up with pixels due to it displaying differently when in your hand, when as an item entity and when in an inventory (all 3 are different to how it's displayed in-game, and different to each other), but sometimes the edges of the fence reference the textures in the middle, meaning that it's impossible to fix the discontinuity created without ruining it somewhere else.

I've included the not fixed files as well so hopefully you can see how I went with those... just copy-pasted bits of it to make up the ones that "work".

ARGHHHHH
